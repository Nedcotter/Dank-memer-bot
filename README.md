## How to Use the Bot
When you run the bot it will ask whether you wish to turn on auto sell, what this is is that every hour the bot will sell all sellable items. Next the bot will ask wether you want to give all your money to another acc, this is useful if you are running the bot on an alt account and want to have the bot send you the profits. if you say 'y', the but will prompt you for a username to send the money to, follow the format `@User#0000`

# Any issues just open an issue or message me on discord and i will help as soon as i can

## Android
Unfortunately android is not supported as pyautogui, the librar used to mimic keyboard commands is only supported on Linux, Windows and MacOS

<!-- ## Installation - Android - Difficulty Easy
1. Download 'Termux' from 'F-droid' I recommend this as there are repository issues with the playstore version leaving it practically unusable. F-droid is safe to use, of course make sure its from the official website - https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.termux/
After installing F-droid search for 'Termux' you will be met by this:

2. After installing Termux run `apt update && apt upgrade` this will update the packages.
3. Next run `apt install python`
4. install the required library, 'pyautogui' by running the command `pip install pyautogui`
5. Now we just need git to clone the repo, `pkg install git`
6. Now run `git clone https://github.com/Nedcotter/Dank-memer-bot`
7. cd into the repo, `cd Dank-memer-bot/`
8. -->

## Bot in action
This is after running the bot for about 18 hours straight
We ran 2 bots simultaneously and of course the multiplier has a big impact so the future prestige setting will help with grinding SIGNIFICANTLY
